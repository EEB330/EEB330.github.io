# Prerequisites

This course focuses on the **R** and **Python** programming languages. 
**Git** will also be taught and used for the assignments. 
A good code editor and environment (**Vscode** or **Rstudio**) is also necessary.  
Your take-off will be much easier if you can install all these on your computer *before the first precept*.

### Python
Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
You will also need a package manager to install various packages/extensions. **pip** works great for Linux. **anaconda** is a good option for all OS.  
Please check you can run a simplistic ["hello, world"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) script on your Python installation.

### R

Here are [instructions](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) to install R on Windows, Mac and Linux. 
This includes downloading R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
Linux users might install R directly with their package manager, such as apt.  
Please check you can run a simplistic ["hello, world"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) script on your Python installation.

### Text editor / IDE

Standard usage is to develop code in an integrated development environment (IDE), rather than a simple text editor 
(though some still use old school editors such as [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)). 
We advise to install an IDE, as they show complex code highlighting, can run and help debug code, and connects to AI and git tools.  

One of the most popular IDEs is [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
Vscode has plugins/extensions for many languages, including those for R and Python that you should install.

Another option you can choose is Rstudio, see [here](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) for installation on all OS.
Rstudio is more specific to R (and hence provides more specific tools), but also supports other languages.

### Github

You should also set up a [github account](https://github.com/) and [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) locally. 
For easier interaction with github repositories, it is also advised to setup a SSH authentification key: follow instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
