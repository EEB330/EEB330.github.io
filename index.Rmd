# Preliminaries

## R

The first part of our course will be all in the R programming language, so you should install R on your computer.
You can find it at [https://cran.rstudio.com/index.html](https://cran.rstudio.com/index.html).
On this website, there are instructions for installing it on various different operating systems in English; versions for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux are available.
Linux users likely have a package manager installed on their system, such as apt or pacman, which can also be used for the installation.

The basic installation of R on Windows or Mac OS provides a basic interface for running routines; however, we recommend installing R Studio, a very intuitive interface for using R.
This interface can be found at [http://www.rstudio.com](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) for Windows, Mac OS, or Linux.
