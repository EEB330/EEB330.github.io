# Preliminaries

## R

The first part of our course will be all in the R programming language, so you should install R on your computer.
You can find R at [https://cran.rstudio.com/index.html](https://cran.rstudio.com/index.html).
On this website, there are instructions for installing it on various different operating systems; versions for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux are available.
Linux users likely have a package manager installed on their system, such as apt or pacman, which can also be used for the installation.

The basic installation of R on Windows or Mac OS provides a basic interface for running routines; however, we recommend installing R Studio, an intuitive integrated development environment (IDE) for using R.
This IDE can be found at [http://www.rstudio.com](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) for Windows, Mac OS, or Linux.

## Text editor

Installing a more general text editor is also a good idea. The most popular modern editor is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Vscode has plugins for several languages and lots of useful tools. Other great choices that are a bit more old school are [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). 

## Github

You should also set up a [github account](https://github.com/) and [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) locally. You can also install [Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) to interact with git, but this is optional.
